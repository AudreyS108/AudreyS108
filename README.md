## Hi there! 👋
***I'm Audrey - a passionate student and teen coder based in Auckland, New Zealand.***
* ⛏️ Currently, I'm working on my game for [Hack Club's Daydream](http://daydream.hackclub.com/), a world-wide game jam for teen coders! Take a look at my repositories for more info.
* ✔️ My most recent project completed would be [Pong But Epilepsy](https://github.com/AudreyS108/pong-but-epilepsy), a Python-based game, full of chaos. Check it out!
* 🏫 I am learning learning SQL, as well as GDScript (the script used for the Godot game engine)
* 📋 I'm looking to enter the data science and machine learning fields, or the game development field.
* 🩷 I love creating and playing games as a hobby! Oh yeah I also like watching anime because why not.
* ✨ Fun fact: I'm bilingual - fluent in English and Chinese! Right now, I'm also learning Cantonese and Japanese.
* ♀️ Pronouns: she/her
